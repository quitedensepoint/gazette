<span class="paperdefault">Recent days of moderate attack by enemy bombers has caused German  RD&P facilities  in the Frankfurt region to fall behind in production output. Despite continuous efforts by German Air Force units to help protect the important  RD&P facilities in Frankfurt, the damage has taken its toll, dropping factory output to 78% of total capacity. This is causing severe consequences for all units running low on equipment and facing the newer weapons that their Allied adversaries are beginning to field in numbers at the front.
