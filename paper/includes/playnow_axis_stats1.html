<span class="paperdefault">Allied armor units  breached the 302 mile German frontlines last night. Allied armor inflitrated several towns as the two sides clashed in bitter engagements in several key breaches in Axis lines. Reports of  fresh armor reinforcements pouring through the breaks in the line of German defenses filtered back from all combat zones currently experiencing high levels of enemy activity.</span>
