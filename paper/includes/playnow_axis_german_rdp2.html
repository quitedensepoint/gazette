<span class="paperdefault">High Command representitives of the German Army speaking from Maastricht .. there to inspect progress of the new Pak38 were quoted as saying production of the Pak38 should be taking precedence over other weapons which will probably be scaled back in an effort to increase battlefield effectiveness of their units at the front.
